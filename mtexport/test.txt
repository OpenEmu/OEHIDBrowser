I forgot how awesome the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=CASS80309052244&sql=Bsddnvwdta9tk">Dance Hall Crashers</a> are.  I just added <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=davedribishom-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00000JS10%2Fref%3Dpd_rhf_p_2%3Fno%3D%252A%26s%3Dmusic%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D5174">Purr</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=davedribishom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> to my MP3 collection, and I can't stop listening to it.  Beverly Kills, Won't Be The Same, and Cricket... wow!  The catchy female vocal harmonies get locked in my brain.  It's not really ska, more pop-punk, but it still rocks.  I've been listening to so much electronic music lately, it's a good change of pace.
